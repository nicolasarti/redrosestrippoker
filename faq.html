Rose Strip Poker</div><div> </div><div>the first Strip Poker themed video game designed to be a work of art</div><div> </div><div>100% open source and independent software. Compatible with Windows and Linux PCs.</div><div> </div><div>Born with the idea of ​​providing a useful tool for photographers, video makers and models to be able to express their art and monetize by creating a customized Strip Poker themed video game, protecting their work and their privacy.</div><div> </div><div>Maximum confidentiality and the ability to monetize: the contents are encrypted, in addition the author can distribute the game so that an activation key is requested when starting and / or when a certain stage is reached. The activation key will work only on that pc.</div><div> </div><div>It is not necessary to install anything to play, just download the archive and unpack it in a folder of your choice which can therefore also be an external hard disk or SSD.</div><div> </div><div>Opportunity to monetize: maximum flexibility, any activation key to unlock the game can be provided after receiving payment through any online or non-online tool. For the maximum protection of privacy or to divide the proceeds among several people, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can also be used. A simple bitcoin payment checker is already included in Red Rose Strip Poker.</div><div> </div><div>Smart contracts: for maximum privacy and transparency, always taking advantage of cryptocurrencies, a smart contract can also be created to automatically distribute earnings to both the photographer and the model.</div><div> </div><div>FAQ:</div><div> </div><div>what is Red Rose Strip Poker? it is an opensource video game, developed independently and based on other opensource projects. You can find the source code here https://github.com/nicolasarti/Red-Rose-Strip-Poker You are free to reuse and modify the source code to create your own strip poker themed video game. I only ask that you do not re-use the Red Rose Strip Poker name and / or the graphics and / or multimedia content published by me.</div><div> </div><div>How does Red Rose Strip Poker stand out from other similar video games?<br>first of all it is not a commercial product and the source code is open and available on github for modification and improvement.<br>In addition to this, from the gamer's point of view, it is a light video game that takes up few resources, it can work without problems even on dated PCs or on a VM, it does not have any kind of bloatware. Yet the graphics are not so bad and the contents can be of very high quality (eg 4K resolution). The multimedia contents with which Red Rose Strip Poker is produced are assembled trying to provide a work of art trying to look to the future with a retrospective eye towards the first strip poker themed video games of the 80s.</div><div> </div><div>How can I create my own video game? A step by step guide will be posted on this site soon.</div><div> </div><div>I am a model/photographer, how can I monetize once I have created the customized video game with my shots / clips? In a thousand ways. For example, you can agree with the photographer to divide the earnings for each copy sold. To do this, I strongly recommend using Bitcoin or other similar cryptocurrencies.  Why? Because it is the only 100% transparent method; Although bitcoin transactions are anonymous, they are public, knowing the address of the wallet on which monitoring is active it will be possible to monitor in real time how many copies of the game have been sold. If you have agreed to divide the earnings by 50%, it will be possible to verify that the earnings have been divided correctly. Furthermore, using a smart contract no manual actions will be necessary, for example when a certain amount is reached, the content of the game wallet is automatically divided into the percentages agreed at the time of creating the smart contract, on the photographer's wallet and on the model's wallet. Who will then be able to decide individually whether to accumulate cryptocurrency, spend or have everything converted into euros. Nobody forbids the models to be able to produce the video game in a totally self-produced way and therefore monetize 100% of the profits. How? By self-producing the images / clips, the result will obviously be more amateurish but it could still have a following.</div><div> </div><div>What is a smart contract? it is simply a software that runs in the cloud whose execution and whose results are guaranteed intact by a public blockchain. In practice, the proceeds will be automatically forwarded to the wallets of the photographer and model. A smart contract of this type does not require that any contract be signed or any personal data exchanged. It is sufficient for the parties to provide their respective public addresses (public key) of the bitcoin wallet. Some easy-to-use wallets are the Conio and Coinbase apps, even the Hype rechargeable card app allows you to hold and / or change bitcoins into euros or vice versa and therefore to be able to spend them with maximum flexibility. There are many other wallets / services used for this purpose.</div><div> </div><div>I am a model or a photographer, I have the multimedia material ready for the game but I am not a programmer and I cannot produce my own version of the video game. How can I do? I can help you or I can produce the game for you. I will only ask you for a small percentage of the proceeds from your game and I will be happy to cooperate.</div><div> </div><div>I am a model/photographer; i created my game now how do i distribute and monetize it? You can distribute it as you want, for example by uploading it to dropbox, google drive and similar services and then using any platform such as social, ebay or other to promote it. An easy way to monetize is to set the request for the activation key (which can be at the start of the game and / or upon reaching a certain level), after which you can request for monetization<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> via bitcoin, paypal, onlyfans, ecc...  theoretically whatever you want, and send the activation key via email. Bitcoin is only needed to divide the proceeds and / or to have maximum privacy.</span><div> </div><div>I downloaded the game but my antivirus tells me it might be malware, what does that mean? Red Rose Strip Poker does not contain malware, the source code is public, some antivirus often detect self-produced software as potential malware and therefore not very widespread. Inquire with the antivirus support to report a false positive and you will see that in the end you will be confirmed to be free from viruses! The more these video games spread, the more the problem will disappear!</div><div> </div><div>I have an Apple Mac but I see it is not supported, can't I play? Mac systems are not supported today but you can use virtualization software such as Parallels, vmware workstation or virtualbox that allow you to install Windows or Linux within the mac os operating system.</div><div> </div><div>I would like to play from my smartphone or tablet, is it possible? To date it is not possible and there is no version for smartphone or tablet</div><div> </div><div>I would like to play via web browser is it possible? No there is no web based version.</div><div> </div><div>What can I do to play this video game while maintaining privacy? No data is ever collected by Red Rose Strip Poker, furthermore you can use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies because they will not leave traces on your bank statement, furthermore you are free to keep the game on an external encrypted device or to play it inside a virtual machine using for example vmware or virtulbox.</div><div> </div><div>I downloaded and played the demo version, I saw that there are no underwear or nude scenes, is there a version where the nude is also included? No, the demo version being such, distributed for free and freely playable, does not include intimate / nude scenes, try the other complete versions with other models that will be published.</div><div> </div><div>I bought the game but once I changed my pc it stopped working, what can I do? This is normal behavior, when you activate the game, activation is intended on that single PC. If you want to use it on another PC you need to do another activation. You will only have to follow the instructions on the screen, if you have kept the activation key you will not need to purchase the game again.</div><div> </div><div>I am a model an I want to take part of Red Rose Strip Poker, way I work with you?
