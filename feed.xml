                <div>Red Rose Strip Poker is based on the <a href="https://github.com/ksge/ksge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source Kiss Strip Game Engine project </a>and fully embraces the philosophy with which this engine tries to provide a strip themed video game capable of giving emotions. The clips are organized according to the emotional situations described below and to have the maximum longevity for each type of situation multiple shots or clips are made which will then be proposed randomly during gameplay,making each game unique and unrepeatable:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CAR abbreviation of <strong>CARDS</strong> the situation in which the model starts a new hand of poker and then shuffles or distributes the playing cards</div>

<div> </div>
<div>RIS abbreviation of <strong>RISK</strong>, the situation in which the model is playing a hand of poker full of tension because it is "risky" in the sense that in case of further defeat she will have to remove a garment. These clips should perhaps be the ones that convey the most evident and conflicting emotions, for example the model could convey the tension given by not wanting to absolutely lose this hand of poker and therefore she can also show her concern or embarrassment, perhaps taking time but why not he could also try to distract the opponent with winks or try to make him uncomfortable by showing himself extremely sure of herself, it all depends on how you want to play the part, on the attitude of the model; conflicting emotions are welcome. Obviously these emotions will be barely hinted at at the beginning and growing with the passage of the removed clothing.</div>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>OFF</strong> the situation in which the model has lost the poker hand and therefore she has to remove a garment. Generally the first clothes removed could be accessories (for example one or two jewels, the belt, hair tie, glasses etc.), the way to do it will be simply playful, but clearly with the continuation of the game things will change and here based on the attitude of the model, emphasis will be given, for example, to moving slowly, to slowly and carefully remove clothing or to undo the buttons of a garment slowly as if they were petals of a flower or even why not hesitating a few seconds in indecision which garment to remove or acting with anger or embarrassment or on the contrary provoking with maximum sensuality and later still using glamorous techniques such as hand bra rather than covering up with poker cards, thus asking to play an extra poker hand ... here all the art of the model and the photographer / video maker comes into play.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>also there are two other types of clips that however do not concern the gameplay but simply the introduction scenes to the game and the final scenes:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ENT abbreviation of <strong>ENTER</strong> the situation in which the game begins the model shows up showing her outfit or walking around the location with a smile and why not a joke</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>END</strong> the situation in which the model has lost the game by remaining naked and therefore based on her attitude and art she will elegantly show all her beauty by posing freely.</div>

                <div>Photography already has this wonderful power, just like many forms of art such as painting, sculpture but also literature and many others ...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we want to understand a video game as a work of art, I think that the latter in turn has nothing less and indeed, is able to include many of the art forms listed above .. so why not?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And if the idea is that of strip poker, taking advantage of the situation as a starting point to range from various genres such as glamor, portrait, nude art but why not also fashion, still life or other ...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let's imagine that we have produced the video game, so that we have worked in perfect synergy with a beautiful model, taking all the shots and clips with the utmost care, having assembled everything taking care of every detail with the aim of creating a work of art. The result will be something beautiful both for a gamer who is passionate about games of this type, and for those who love photography and female beauty, beautiful and elegant first of all for the photographer and the model who have created something unique by giving space to the own art and if wanted with the possibility of even being able to monetize.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let's spend 20-30 years ... let's play this old video game and try to imagine what emotions it will give us ... yes, this is a wonderful way to make beauty eternal ...</div>

<div>the Red Rose Strip Poker video game is distributed as per the following license without any kind of warranty and relieving the author of any responsibility</div>
<div> </div>
<div>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
<div>Version 2, June 1991</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</div>
<div>51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</div>
<div>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Preamble</div>
<div>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</div>
<div>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</div>
<div>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>NO WARRANTY</div>
<div> </div>
<div>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<div>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</div>
<div>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</div>
<div>Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or</div>
<div>modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License</div>
<div>as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2</div>
<div>of the License, or (at your option) any later version.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</div>
<div>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</div>
<div>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</div>
<div>GNU General Public License for more details.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</div>
<div>along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software</div>
<div>Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.</div>
<div>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details</div>
<div>type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome</div>
<div>to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'</div>
<div>for details.</div>
<div>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright</div>
<div>interest in the program `Gnomovision'</div>
<div>(which makes passes at compilers) written</div>
<div>by James Hacker.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989</div>

                <p>Nicolas Bellearti's idea was born in 2013 initially as a simple photographic project, simple card / strip poker themed shoots designed to artistically emphasize the situation, ranging in a natural and playful way between fashion, portrait, glamor and artistic nude genres and is based on some famous photographs and paintings with clear references to the game of strip poker, mostly dating back to the fifties / sixties:</p>

<div>
<div>the models portrayed in these works convey a great playfulness as well as other strong contrasting emotions such as innocence, sometimes even embarrassment; mixed with the desire to provoke, wink and transgress by exhibiting one's beauty, simply with a mischievous look or smile as well as showing one's body, or part of it, or perhaps hiding, even modestly, nudity with typically glamorous techniques such as for example hand-bra all in a beautiful crescendo of contrasting emotions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another aspect that inspired the work of Nicolas Bellearti later, in 2020 and at closing the circle, are strip poker themed video games, nowadays there are many and with high resolution videos / images, but which at least Nicolas Bellearti's opinion has nothing to do with art; so much so that perhaps the products with a minimum of artistic content were the very first video games of this type dating back to the 80s, such as Samantha Fox Strip Poker https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Fox_Strip_Poker, released for the legendary Commodore 64:</div>

<div>
<div>The fact that the graphics were produced on such a limited machine made it a certain charm, somehow made the imagination work and somehow with Red Rose Strip Poker we want to merge the artistic aspect of the strip poker theme, of nude photography / glamor and wanting to self-produce a video game nowadays in ways that are partly comparable to what happened in the 80's. Red Rose Strip Poker looks to the future but with a retrospective perspective.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The result is what you can see and wants to try to stand out and be considered a real new genre, it can foresee the nude, sometimes even integral and explicit, but this is never an end in itself, everything that revolves around counts. naked in an artistic way, the way of posing one's body by posing and using glamorous techniques, feeling the story, feeling the situation and making it one's own by transmitting true emotions.</div>

                <div>Red Rose Strip Poker</div>
<div> </div>
<div>the first Strip Poker themed video game series designed to be art</div>
<div> </div>
<div>100% open source and independent software. Compatible with Windows and Linux PCs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Born with the idea of ​​providing a useful tool for photographers, video makers and models to be able to express their art and even monetize if needed by creating a customized Strip Poker themed video game, protecting their work and their privacy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maximum confidentiality and the ability to monetize: the contents are encrypted, in addition the author can distribute the game so that an activation key is requested when starting and / or when a certain stage is reached. The activation key will work only on that pc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is not necessary to install anything to play, just download the archive and unpack it in a folder of your choice which can therefore also be an external hard disk or SSD.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Opportunity to monetize: maximum flexibility, any activation key to unlock the game can be provided after receiving payment through any online or non-online tool. For the maximum protection of privacy or to divide the proceeds among several people, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can also be used. A simple bitcoin payment checker is already included in Red Rose Strip Poker.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Smart contracts: for maximum privacy and transparency, always taking advantage of cryptocurrencies, a smart contract can also be created to automatically distribute earnings to both the photographer and the model.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>FAQ:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>what is Red Rose Strip Poker? it is an opensource video game, developed independently and based on the Kiss Strip Poker Maker project <a href="https://github.com/ksge/kspm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/ksge/kspm</a>. You can find the full Red Rose Strip Poker source code here https://github.com/nicolasarti/Red-Rose-Strip-Poker You are free to reuse and modify the source code to create your own strip poker themed video game. I only ask that you do not re-use the Red Rose Strip Poker name and / or the graphics and / or multimedia content published by me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How does Red Rose Strip Poker stand out from other similar video games?<br>first of all it is not a commercial product and the source code is open and available on github for modification and improvement.<br>In addition to this, from the gamer's point of view, it is a light weight video game that takes up few resources, it can work without problems even on old PCs or on a VM, it does not have any kind of bloatware. Yes the graphics are not so bad and the media contents can be of very high quality (eg 4K resolution). The multimedia contents with which Red Rose Strip Poker is produced are assembled trying to provide a work of art trying to look to the future with a retrospective eye towards the first strip poker themed video games of the 80s.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How can I create my own video strip poker game? I suggest you to learn to use the excellent <a href="https://github.com/ksge/kspm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiss Strip Poker Maker project</a>, it is very simple and you can easily get excellent results, once you have learned how to use this engine you can customize the graphics or modify and improve other aspects if you want.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have build my own Strip Poker game, how can I monetize now? you are free to sold it on any platform like ebay, patreon and many more.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am a model or a photographer, I have the multimedia material ready for the game but I am not a programmer and I cannot produce my own version of the video game. How can I do? I can try to help you and I will be happy to cooperate, contact me!</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>I downloaded the game but my antivirus tells me it might be malware, what does that mean? Red Rose Strip Poker does not contain malware, the source code is public, some antivirus some times detect self-produced rare software as potential malware and therefore not very widespread. Inquire with the antivirus support to report a false positive and you will see that in the end you will be confirmed that the game is 100% free from viruses! The more these video games are played in the world, the more the problem will disappear!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have an Apple Mac but I see it is not supported, can't I play? Mac systems are not supported today but you can easilyuse virtualization software such as Parallels, vmware workstation or virtualbox that allow you to install Windows or Linux within the mac os operating system.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would like to play from my smartphone or tablet, is it possible? To date it is not possible and there is no version for smartphone or tablet</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would like to play via web browser is it possible? No there is no web based version.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What can I do to play this video game while maintaining privacy? No data is ever collected by Red Rose Strip Poker,  furthermore you are free to keep the game on an external encrypted device or to play it inside a virtual machine using for example vmware or virtulbox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I downloaded and played the demo version, I saw that there are no underwear or nude scenes, is there a version where the nude is also included? No, the demo version does not include intimate / nude scenes, try the other complete versions with other models that will be published.</div>
<div> </div>
